# **Adventurer Conqueror King System** for Foundry VTT
This game system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop provides character sheet and game system support for the Adventurer Conqueror King System (ACKS).

This system provides mechanics and character sheet support, and features a compendium with Items, Spells, Proficiencies and Abilities, and more, all to make the judge's job easier for running ACKS games on the Foundry VTT. Also included is a world map of the Auran Empire (the default setting of ACKS) - although the judge is free to ignore it. Every campaign is a law unto itself.

ACKS, like most B/X clones, is also broadly compatible with thousands of modules and other OSR content and rulesets with a minimum of conversion necessary.

## ACKS for Foundry VTT Features
#### **Core Rules**
- ACKS encumbrance rules (*using coin weight instead of stone* - 1000 coins to a stone)  
- ACKS Armor Class (Ascending starting from 0)
- Uncapped dexterity and charisma bonuses  
- Exploration checks (hear noise, open door, etc) are 1d20 skill checks  
- Tweak section of the character sheet to modify throws, AC, etc for proficiencies or class bonuses
- "Slow Weapon" checkbox on items to subtract 1 from an actor's initiative if equipped
- HOLD TURN icon in the Combat Tracker to remind the judge that a player has held their action
- Encumbrance bar to reflect movement rates while encumbered
- Pre-programmed saving throws for monsters based on HD
- Auran setting languages in addition to standard tongues
- Morale and Loyalty tracking for Henchmen
- The ACKS Compendium has the majority of equipment, proficiencies, and spells from the Core Book. (Soon to have tables and core bestiary)

#### **Heroic Fantasy Handbook** (*optional*)
- Added an option to use exploding 20s in combat from HFH optional rules  
- Added an option to add Basic Healing Rate to the character sheet from HFH optional rules  
#### **Houserules** (*optional*)
- Added the popular wisdom bonus houserule to settings menu. Selecting it removes the prompt during rolling a save and declutters the Save vs Magic field from the sheet.
