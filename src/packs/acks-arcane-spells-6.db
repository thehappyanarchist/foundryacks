The wall of corpses can be as large as 1,200 square feet, and may be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120' long and 10' high, or a protective circle 10' high with a 10' radius.</p>\n<p>Upon first seeing a wall of corpses, creatures must make a successful saving throw versus Spells or flee in terror for 30 rounds. Any creatures approaching within 5' of the wall are subject to attack as if from a zombie (see the Monsters Chapter of ACKS) each round.</p>\n<p>A dispel magic or a disintegrate spell will destroy a wall of corpses immediately. The wall of corpses can also be affected by normal or magical attacks, fire, cold, lightning, or any other physical or magical effect, but is quite sturdy, having AC 4 and 2 Hit Dice per level of the caster. A wall of corpses may be turned by a cleric as an Infernal creature; successfully turning the wall of corpses will cause the corpses within to lose their animating force, rendering it merely an inert, fleshy barrier for the duration of the turning. The wall of corpses may not be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are.</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 145</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
