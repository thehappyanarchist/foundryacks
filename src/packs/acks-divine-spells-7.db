{"name":"Cataclysm","permission":{"default":0,"8aW4oRW193riCvGu":3},"type":"spell","data":{"lvl":7,"class":"divine","duration":"1 day","range":"special","roll":"","description":"<p>When a divine spellcaster performs the cataclysm ritual, he is unleashing the full wrath of his god. The nature of the cataclysm will depend on the deity the spellcaster serves: Ammonar, Lord of the Dawn favors a meteor from the heavens, while Telith, the Earth Mother, often sends earthquakes, and Dirgion the Doom Lord prefers a rain of hell fire. Regardless of its form, a cataclysm will affect one domain with an area of up to 16 6-mile hexes (or 1 24-mile hex). It can affect both the domain and any urban settlement within the domain, but each should be treated separately.</p>\n<p>A cataclysm has unlimited range, but the caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain. Cataclysm cannot be cast against the domain of a ruler of the same alignment and religion as the divine caster, and is usually reserved for punishing terrible heresies or during holy wars. A cataclysm’s special component is always divine power (see Divine Power in Chapter 7 of ACKS for more details).</p>\n<p>Once the cataclysm ritual is begun, ominous signs and portents (swelling tides, falling stars, rippling fault-lines, etc.) will warn of imminent doom, with increasing frequency as the ritual nears completion. A miracle or wish, if available, can be used during this time period to avert the cataclysm. The death of the ritual’s caster will also avert the cataclysm. Left unchecked, the actual cataclysm will occur when the ritual is completed.</p>\n<p>If it is allowed to occur, the cataclysm devastates the target domain. The extent of damage caused by the cataclysm will depend on the population density of the affected domain. For every 1,000 families in a domain, each stronghold and each urban settlement will lose 3d6x1000gp in value, and 1d10x100 families will be slain. (Where the number of dice is quite large, the Judge can simply use the average values or use an online die rolling tool). If the remaining stronghold value or urban investment value in the hex is too low to sustain the domain’s population, it will immediately lose any excess population as the population scatters. A domain subject to a cataclysm must also make an immediate domain morale roll with a -4 penalty.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Mentu the Death-Priest unleashes a cataclysm on the domain of Aura itself. A band of heroes fails to stop him in time, and the cataclysm occurs as rains of hell fire plummet downward. Aura has a population of 12,500 plus an urban settlement with 100,000 families. Its stronghold value is 720,000gp and its urban investment is 2,500,000gp.</p>\n<p>The cataclysm causes the loss of (12,500/1000 x 1d10x100) 12d10x100 peasant families and (100,000/1000 x 1d10x100) 100d10x100 urban families. The dice result in the loss of 5,700 peasant families and 54,400 urban families. The cataclysm also causes the loss of (12,500/1000 x 3d6x1000gp) 36d6x1000gp in stronghold value and (100,000/1000 x 3d6x1000gp) 300d6x1000gp in urban investment. The dice result in the loss of 132,000gp in stronghold value and 1,085,000gp in urban investment.</p>\n<p>Kristopher Saxton</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 146</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}

Unlike wish, however, miracles are fulfilled indirectly, via the intercessory power of the cleric’s deity, and successful fulfillment of the miracle is contingent on the approval of the deity rather than on the precise wording used. Miracles which do not advance the agenda of the deity will invariably go unfulfilled, and unless the miracle is obviously self-sacrificing on the part of the divine caster, the deity will subject him to a quest when the miracle is granted.
