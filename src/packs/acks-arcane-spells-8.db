Time ceases to flow for the subject; its body does not age, its condition does not change, and no force or effect can harm it.

A common condition is a particular alignment of the stars or outer planes. Temporal stasis may be cast against an unwilling target, but a successful saving throw versus Death allows the target to avoid being placed into temporal stasis.</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 148</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
