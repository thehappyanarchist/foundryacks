This utterance attracts the creature’s attention and allows it, or its representative, to travel to the caster’s vicinity by means of an interdimensional portal simultaneously created by the ritual’s completion – the eponymous gate itself. If the creature named is anything short of a deity or demon lord, it will usually travel through the gate itself. Gods, demon lords, and other planar rulers will likely send a representative rather than come through the gate personally. The Judge’s discretion is final with regard to what creature comes through the gate.</p>\n<p>In either case, the creature arriving through the gate is not under the control of the caster. Its actions will be determined by its alignment, its relationship with the caster, the reason for its summoning, and the nature of the threats it confronts. If a creature is called by a caster of an opposed alignment seeking assistance in pursuing goals contrary to the creature’s own, it will attempt to destroy the caster if possible, or depart if not. If a creature is called for a trifling matter (relative to its own power), it might depart immediately, or perhaps linger long enough to chastise the caster for his impudence, even going so far as to lay a curse or quest upon him. Usually, however, the creature will provide some aid or assistance to the caster, especially if his need is great and his goals align with those of the creature itself.</p>\n<p>After aiding the caster, the creature will typically demand payment of some sort for its service – the payment demanded might be services, treasure, blood sacrifices, or even some part of the caster’s own body, such as an eye or hand. The payment demand is at the Judge’s discretion based on the power of the creature relative to the caster and the reason for its summoning.</p>\n<p>For creatures other than gods and demon lords summoned to aid characters of their own alignment, a payment of 1,000 gp (or equivalent) per HD of the creature will usually suffice.</p>\n<p>Casting a gate ritual requires 4,500 gp of divine power as its special component.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 154</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
{"name":"Lair of Power","permission":{"default":0,"8aW4oRW193riCvGu":3},"type":"spell","data":{"lvl":9,"class":"eldritch","duration":"permanent","range":"special","roll":"","description":"<p>This ritual transforms the caster’s lair into a place of power.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this spell, a lair can be a man-made or natural site encompassing an area of up to 10,000 square feet and a volume of up to 100,000 square feet. For example, a lair might encompass the entirety of a rambling one-story manor house (100’ long x 100’ wide x 10’ tall) or a tall, spindly stone pillar (30’ long x 30’ wide x 110’ tall).</p>\n<p>When the ritual is begun, the caster selects the type of place he desires his lair to become: either a pinnacle of good, sinkhole of evil, aerie of air, edifice of earth, furnace of fire, or well of water.</p>\n<p>In order to create a lair of power of a particular type, the caster must meet the requirements noted below for that type.       Type of Place Requirement Pinnacle of Good Caster must be Lawful and have no corrupting weaknesses Sinkhole of Evil Caster must be Chaotic and have at least five corrupting weaknesses Aerie of Air Caster must know at least one elemental air spell of each level (1st – 6th) Edifice of Earth Caster must know at least one elemental earth spell of each level (1st – 6th) Furnace of Fire Caster must know at least one elemental fire spell of each level (1st – 6th) Well of Water Caster must know at least one elemental water spell of each level (1st – 6th) While the ritual is being performed, the lair must be kept empty of any creatures except the caster and his assistants, apprentices, henchmen, followers, familiars, animal companions, charmed or necromantic slaves, and similar allies. If other creatures arrive in the lair during the ritual, they must be slain, driven off, or enlisted into the caster’s service before the ritual can proceed.</p>\n<p>When the ritual is complete, the caster’s lair becomes a minor place of power of the chosen type. If the lair is already a minor place of power of the chosen type, the lair becomes a major place of power of that type instead. If the lair is already a major place of power of the chosen type, the lair becomes a supreme place of power of that type instead.</p>\n<p>If the lair is already a supreme place of power of the chosen type, the caster must immediately make a saving throw versus Spells.</p>\n<p>Fate Points cannot be spent on this roll. If the save succeeds, the lair of power gains a permanent gate to the appropriate sphere of existence. If the save fails, the caster is immediately disintegrated and a cataclysm appropriate to the type of place occurs in the hex, centered on the lair.</p>\n<p>A caster may “stack” multiple lairs of power of different types in the same physical area if desired. However, he must meet all of the requirements for each type of place and perform separate rituals (or series of rituals) for each type. For instance, a caster might perform the ritual three times to create a roaring (major) aerie of air and smoldering (minor) furnace of fire.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 154</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
