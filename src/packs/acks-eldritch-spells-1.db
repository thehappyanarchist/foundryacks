The spell does not create the smoke itself, so it must be cast on morning mist, banks of fog, smoke from a fire, etc. The smoke may not be woven so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, nor can it be woven into creatures. The smoke may not be woven to be less than 1” thick.</p>\n<p>Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the smoke into almost any shape he desires. The resulting shape need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation. If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven smoke will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Smoke never presents an obstacle to movement or magical effects (except for those requiring a line of sight to target, of course). Once woven, the smoke can still be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A disintegrate or dispel magic spell will disperse the woven smoke instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 153</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
