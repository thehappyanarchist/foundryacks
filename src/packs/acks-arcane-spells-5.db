Tiny creatures (the size of a house pet or smaller) are knocked down and rolled 1d4x10', taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10'. If flying, a tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10' feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.</p>\n<p>Small creatures, such as halflings or goblins, are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are knocked back 1d6x10' feet. Man-sized creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are knocked back 1d6x5' feet.</p>\n<p>Creatures of ogre size or larger may move normally within a scouring wind.</p>\n<p>Missile attack throws within or through a scouring wind are at a -4 penalty, as are proficiency throws to hear noise. The force of the scouring wind automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly, with a 50% chance of being extinguished. A scouring wind will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 140</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
