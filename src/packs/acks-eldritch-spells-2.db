The caster must speak the charmed creature’s language to communicate any commands.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 152</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
