{"name":"Symbol","permission":{"default":0,"8aW4oRW193riCvGu":3},"type":"spell","data":{"lvl":8,"class":"eldritch","duration":"special","range":"touch","roll":"","description":"<p>This ritual allows the caster to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. To be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Symbols are visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol works normally.</p>\n<p>Until it is triggered, a symbol is inactive. By default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. The caster can choose to limit the trigger to just a few or one of these triggers if desired. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.   When triggered, a symbol will affect one or more creatures within 60 feet of the rune. The effect will vary depending on the type of symbol inscribed. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol is active may be subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.</p>\n<p>When scribing a symbol, the caster can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.</p>\n<p>Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p>\n<p>There are eight different kinds of symbol, each of which has a different effect when triggered. Some of the symbols are considered black magic, however, and scribing those symbols will earn the caster corruption.</p>\n<p>Conflict: The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to begin arguing with others in their area for 5d4 rounds. Arguing creatures of differing alignment may (50% chance) fight for 2d4 rounds. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of conflict with successful saving throws versus Spells.</p>\n<p>Death (black): The symbol slays one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 80. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to slay.</p>\n<p>Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of death with successful saving throws versus Death.</p>\n<p>Despair (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to endure feelings of hopelessness and futility for 3d4 turns.</p>\n<p>Affected creatures will automatically cower, surrender, or retreat in the face of determined opposition. Otherwise they have a 25% chance per round of taking no action due to their despair.</p>\n<p>Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of despair with successful saving throws versus Paralysis.</p>\n<p>Fear (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to flee at their running speed for 30 rounds, as if affected by the spell fear. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of fear with successful saving throws versus Spells at -4.</p>\n<p>Insanity (black): The symbol causes one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 120 to become permanently insane (as the incite madness spell). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. The insanity can only be cured with ritual magic. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of insanity with successful saving throws versus Spells.</p>\n<p>Pain (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to endure wracking pains for 2d10 turns. Affected creatures suffer a -1 penalty to initiative, -1 penalty to armor class, and -4 penalty to attack throws. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of pain with successful saving throws versus Spells.</p>\n<p>Sleep: The symbol causes all creatures of 8 HD or less within 60’ to fall into a catatonic slumber for 1d12+4 turns.</p>\n<p>Catatonic creatures cannot be awakened by non-magical means before this time expires. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of sleep with successful saving throws versus Death.</p>\n<p>Stunning: The symbol causes one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 160 to become stunned and unable to act for 3d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>Any held items will be dropped. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of stunning with successful saving throws versus Paralysis.</p>\n<p>Casting a symbol ritual requires special components worth 4,000 gp total.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 155</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
