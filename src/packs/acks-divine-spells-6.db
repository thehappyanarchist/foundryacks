If the alignment differs by one degree (e.g. a Neutral creature entering an area of Lawful forbiddance), the creature suffers 6d6 points of damage. If the alignment differs by two degrees (e.g. a Lawful creature entering an area of Chaotic forbiddance), the creature suffers 12d6 points of damage. In either case, the creature may make a saving throw versus Spells to reduce the damage to half.</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 147</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
