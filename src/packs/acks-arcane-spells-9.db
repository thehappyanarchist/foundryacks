{"name":"Plague","permission":{"default":0,"8aW4oRW193riCvGu":3},"type":"spell","data":{"lvl":9,"class":"arcane","duration":"1 month","range":"special","roll":"","description":"<p>This ritual creates a terrible pestilence that devastates the local population. The plague initially targets one 6-mile hex. Each month, it affects an additional 6-mile hex adjacent to those already affected. Each hex targeted by plague loses 1d10 families for every 100 families each month. Any die that rolls a 10 should be rolled again, with the new result added to the total (repeating the process if a subsequent 10 is rolled).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A 1-hex barony with a population of 700 families is subject to plague. Each month it loses 7d10 families. After 14 months, the barony has lost a total of 505 families from a roll of 98d10.</p>\n<p>A plague can devastate a domain’s morale as well as its population. Any time that a domain affected by plague must make a morale roll, its morale score is reduced by 1 point prior to making the roll.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A 1-hex barony with a morale score of +1 (Loyal) is subject to plague in the first month of the year. At the end of three months, the barony must make its seasonal morale roll; the morale score is reduced by 1 point, to 0 (Apathetic). The domain then makes its morale roll; the result is a 4, meaning morale is reduced by 1 point, to -1 (Demoralized). Another three months passes, and the barony must make another seasonal morale roll.</p>\n<p>Its morale score is reduced by another point, to -2. It then makes its morale roll. The result is, luckily, a 9, so its morale score is increased by 1 point, back to -1.</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 147</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
{"name":"Undead Legion","permission":{"default":0,"8aW4oRW193riCvGu":3},"type":"spell","data":{"lvl":9,"class":"arcane","duration":"permanent","range":"touch","roll":"","description":"<p>This ritual can only be cast in a place of death (such as a cemetery, catacomb, or battleground). When it is complete, the spellcaster raises an undead legion under his command from the corpses and skeletons residing therein. The undead legion will include a number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies equal to 200 times the caster’s level, subject to the maximum number of dead in his area. Whether the undead legion consists of skeletons or zombies will depend on the state of the corpses in the surrounding area. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life, excluding class levels; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the class level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life. The undead legion normally lasts for just one week, but the spellcaster can make the spell permanent by sprinkling 1 vial of unholy water per Hit Die on each zombie or skeleton. If this is done, the undead remain animated until they are destroyed or dispelled.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Sebek, a 14th level mage, travels to the catacombs of Old Zahar, in order to perform the undead legion ritual. After 9 weeks, his Magic Research throw succeeds, so he animates 2,800 Hit Dice of undead. Since the Old Zaharans mummified the dead, the corpses are relatively intact and become zombies.</p>\n<p>Sebek’s undead legion consists of 1,400 2 HD human zombies.</p>\n<p>Sebek then sprinkles his army with unholy water so that it will remain animated indefinitely. The ritual has taken 9 weeks to complete, at a cost of 74,500gp (4,500gp for the ritual and 70,000gp for unholy water). Compared to the cost of training and equipping 1,400 heavy infantry (177,800gp), Sebek considers his ritual a wise investment.</p>\n<p>Note that if undead legion is cast in a sinkhole of evil, the spellcaster will calculate the spell effects as if he were one or more class levels higher than his actual level of experience. See Sinkholes of Evil in Chapter 10 of ACKS for more information on sinkholes and places of death.</p>\n<p>Source: Players Compendium page 148</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
