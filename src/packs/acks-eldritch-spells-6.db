The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than two days at 7th level, and four days are added per level above 7. For example, a 9th level caster can restore semblance of life to a creature that has been dead for 10 days. However, this spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age, lost its head, or had its body cremated.</p>\n<p>Creatures restored to semblance of life do not need bed rest, as the infusion of necromantic energies restores them to immediate vigor. However, the spell has no effect on any permanent wounds the creature may suffer from, so lost limbs, disfiguring scars, or other injuries remain in effect. Many creatures restored to a semblance of life thus awaken as cripples. Worse is the spell’s effect on the subject’s very soul: Any creature restored to a semblance of life will automatically suffer two side effects on the Tampering with Mortality table in ACKS, one from Row 1-5 (“Great Cost”) and one from Row 11-15 (“Intense”).

As a 14th level caster, Balbus is able to restore a creature dead for up to 30 days, so the foul state of Athelstan’s corpse is no obstacle. Athelstan is restored, but he must roll twice on the Tampering with Mortality table. On Row 1-5, Athelstan rolls a 1 – his heart beats and his blood flows, but life is not the same; he loses 1d4 points of CON and WIS. On Row 11-15, Athelstan rolls a 2 – he is disturbed by what he saw on the other side and mumbles constantly. “Eh Ohaoo…Eh ohaoo,” the warrior mutters through his mangled lips and tongue.

The spell is usually cast on bound and helpless victims; if used in combat, it requires a successful melee attack throw to touch the victim. Once touched, the victim must make a saving throw versus Death.</p>\n<p>Even if the saving throw succeeds, the victim is still slain, but his soul eludes the caster’s grasp. If the saving throw fails, the victim is slain and his soul is eaten by the caster. Victims whose souls are eaten cannot be restored to life by any means short of a miracle or wish. The caster immediately gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per level of the victim. In addition, the caster learns some important knowledge possessed by the victim, either a specific set of facts that the caster was seeking or some random knowledge chosen by the Judge. The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language. The temporary hit points will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration, while the knowledge will fade as if it was a barely-remembered dream.</p>\n<p>Nothing prevents a caster from writing down the knowledge gained from this spell before it fades, however.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses wishes to plumb the depths of the dungeon of his rival, Baldur the Black. Baldur’s dungeon is reputed to be a deadly maze filled with traps, secret doors, and foul guardians, so Ra-Ramses abducts Archimedian, the engineer who built the dungeon, and casts soul eating on him. Archimedian (a 5th level loremaster) fails his saving throw v. Death, so his soul is eaten by Ra-Ramses.</p>\n<p>Ra-Ramses gains 1d10 + 5 hp. The Judge decides that having complete knowledge of the layout and design of Baldur’s dungeon is equivalent to the Mapping proficiency, and thus within the purview of the spell. Ra-Ramses now has a day to exploit this knowledge, either by venturing into the dungeon immediately or by spending a day drafting maps.</p>\n<p>While soul eating is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of detect evil and protection from evil effects. A dispel evil or dispel magic spell will strip the caster of his temporary proficiency and hit points unless he makes a successful saving throw versus Spells.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 146</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}

The spellward has a number of layers equal to the caster’s level of experience. The spellward automatically triggers whenever a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect would affect the area. If a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect affects an area that is inclusive of the spellwarded zone, but also affects areas outside the zone, the spellward will trigger, but its protection only extends to its own area of effect.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Quintus, Marcus, Balbus, and Viktir are standing in a large amphitheater, 100’ in radius, the four of them strung out in a line 5’ apart. Quintus, now an 11th level caster, has cast spellwarded zone on a 20’ diameter sphere centered on himself. He, Marcus, and Balbus are all standing in the zone but Viktir is 5’ outside its perimeter. Ramses-Ra calls down a 14th level starfall with a 20’ diameter area of effect that strikes the area where Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus are standing. The spellward is triggered, but Viktir will not benefit from its protection.</p>\n<p>If the triggering effect allows for a saving throw, one layer of the spellward will be automatically expended to provide a +1d4 bonus to the saving throw for the affected area and/or any creature(s) in the area.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra has brought down a 14th level starfall on Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus. It deals 50 points of damage! However, Balbus and Marcus are in a spellwarded zone with 11 layers. The spellward is triggered, and one of its layers is automatically expended to provides a +1d4 bonus to Balbus and Marcus’s saving throws. The die roll is a 3, so both Balbus and Marcus get a +3 bonus to their save.</p>\n<p>Balbus succeeds, but Marcus rolls badly and fails despite the bonus. Viktir, meanwhile, does not get the bonus, but he manages a lucky roll of 19 and succeeds anyway. The starfall will deal 50 points of damage to Marcus and 25 points to Balbus and Viktir.</p>\n<p>If the triggering effect deals damage, one layer of the spellward will be automatically expended for every 5 points of damage the effect deals (ignore any reduction from saving throws), up to the maximum number of layers. Each layer expended reduces the damage by 1d4 points. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the spellward, then any creature(s) in the area are entirely unharmed, and do not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra’s starfall is dealing 50 points of damage. Therefore (50/5) 10 layers of the spellward are automatically expended in order to reduce the damage by 10d4 points. The dice roll results in 30 points of damage reduction. Balbus, whose save succeeded, therefore takes no damage. Marcus, whose save failed, takes (50-30) 20 points of damage. Viktir, whose save succeeded, takes 25 points of damage because he is outside the spellwarded zone.</p>\n<p>If the spellwarded zone is subjected to a dispel magic spell, it will expend one layer of the ward per two caster levels of the dispel in order to increase its effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel the zone. Spellward zone expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made permanent through ritual magic, the spellward recharges two layers per turn.</p>\n<p>Source: Heroic Fantasy Handbook page 147</p>","memorized":0,"cast":0,"save":""},"flags":{"importid":"alexwashere-ruby","dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/acks/assets/icons/Light.webp"}
